Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings is likely due to passing python objects instead of tensors. Also, tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. Please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/eager/tf_function#python_or_tensor_args and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for more details.\n",
